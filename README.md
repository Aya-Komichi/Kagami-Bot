# Kagami-Bot
###### The source code of my revolt bot Kagami.

This is a very small bot I made for the [revolt platform](https://github.com/revoltchat/revolt) using [ruvolt](https://github.com/Arthur-Damasceno/ruvolt).
I had plans to use the Anilist API in this bot, but ended up deciding I am not going to invest this much into revolt for certain reasons.
To run this bot, install rust and run the following commands:

```sh
cargo build
cargo run
```

In case you want to further develop this, I recommend using VSCode with the appropriate extensions.
